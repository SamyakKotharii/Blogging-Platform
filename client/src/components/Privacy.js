          All required information is service dependent and we may use the above

          (including advertising services) and for developing new services.

          Such information will not be considered as sensitive if it is freely
          available and accessible in the public domain or is furnished under

        <h2 className="privacy--title">COOKIES</h2>
        <p className="privacy--para">
          To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use
          "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to
          assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification
          (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the
          Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through
          registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you
          are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal
          information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an example
          of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A cookie
          cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign
          their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a
          process that we do not control.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your
          computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when
          you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers
          attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the
          web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally.
          We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request,
          to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic
          within our site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from
          where our visitors come.

              investigation including cyber incidents, or for prosecution and
              punishment of offences. These disclosures are made in good faith
              and belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for
              enforcing these Terms; for complying with the applicable laws and
              regulations.

              We proposes to share such information within its group companies
              and officers and employees of such group companies for the purpose
              of processing personal information on its behalf. We also ensure
              that these recipients of such information agree to process such

        <h2 className="privacy--title">INFORMATION SECURITY</h2>
        <p className="privacy--para">
          We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized
          access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of
          data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage
          and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate
          encryption and physical security measures to guard against
          unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
          <br />
          <br />
          All information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our
          controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind
          a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is
          strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are,
          no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security
          of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will
          not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
          And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the
          discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.
          <br />
          <br />
          However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our
          Privacy Policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future
          changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always
          be consistent with the policy under which the information was
          collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.
